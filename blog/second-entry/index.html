        Espresso is more than just a type of coffee; it’s a concentrated
        experience, a ritual, and a craft. Known for its rich flavor and
        aromatic intensity, espresso is the foundation of many beloved coffee
        drinks. Let's delve into the world of espresso and discover what makes
        this small yet mighty beverage so special.

      <h2>What is Espresso?</h2>
      <img class="coffee" src="/images/coffee-4334647_1280.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Espresso is a brewing method that forces hot water through finely-ground
        coffee beans under high pressure. This process produces a small,
        concentrated shot of coffee with a layer of rich, creamy foam on top,
        known as crema. The result is a bold, intense flavor profile that
        highlights the essence of the coffee bean.

      <h2>The Art of Making Espresso</h2>

      <p>
        Creating the perfect espresso shot involves precision and skill. Here
        are the key steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Grinding: Use a fine grind to increase the surface area for
          extraction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tamping: Compress the coffee grounds evenly in the portafilter to
          ensure uniform extraction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brewing: Use an espresso machine to force water through the grounds at
          around 9 bars of pressure and at a temperature of about 200°F (93°C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Timing: Aim for an extraction time of 25-30 seconds for a balanced
          shot.
        </li>
      </ol>
